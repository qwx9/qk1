qk1 - port of Quake to 9front
=============================
Does not work. Nothing to see here, move along.

builds only with p9p on linux/386 and amd64; bugged to hell.
plan9 shit missing completely, asm not ungccfied.

intrusive changes:
	- pr_strings: assumed 32bit pointer arithmetic: use PR_GetStr() instead of
	  dealing with it directly; may be ass

bugs
----
	- compile with PARANOID -> MSG_WriteByte complains about range error and
	  exits.  no idea why. (386/amd64)
	- new game while already ingame -> R_RenderView: called without enough
	  stack


legal
-----
Quake, hence qk1, are licensed under the GPLv2. See COPYING for details.
