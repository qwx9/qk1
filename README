qk1 - port of Quake to 9front
=============================
	- based on linux/x11 code from original gpl release
	- setup:
		. mk install
		. mkdir id1
		. cp /n/quakecd/id1/*.pak id1/
		. run from same dir...
	- unfinished and very buggy (both shitty new code and badly ported old code)
	- sound does not work; assume that you should always launch with -nosound
	- assume high resolutions don't work well and are very crash prone (e.g. > 800x600)
		. exit with: Hunk_Alloc: failed on ... => not enough memory
		use [-mem megabytes], e.g.:
			% qk1 -nosound -mem 10
	- don't use -winsize, -width, -height; just resize the window (bugsbugsbugs)
	- mouse is grabbed using _windowed_mouse cvar
		. open console (~)
		. type _windowed_mouse 1 (can autocomplete w/ tab)
		. setting now saved in .cfg
	- assume it can crash with mouse still being captured (in_9.c)
		. if window size < physical screen size, swipe mouse super to exit the window
		(bug in mproc)
	- tested on 386 and amd64 only


port notes
----------
	- pr_strings: assumed 32bit pointer arithmetic: use PR_GetStr() instead of
	  dealing with it directly; may be ass
	- global cppdefotomy, removing code seen as useless for plan9


bugs present in linux/x11
-------------------------
	- compile with PARANOID -> MSG_WriteByte complains about range error and
	  exits. no idea why.
	- new game while already ingame -> front falls off
		. most of the time: exits with R_RenderView: called without enough stack
		. sometimes: goes batshit on the console (->press y again and quit normally, etc.)
	- compile with BAN_TEST -> net_dgrm build fails
	- sprites/particles not scaled on high resolutions
	- mouselook was completely fucked; still is somewhat
		. when paused, if _windowed_mouse 1, can still look around with the mouse, even
		if world is frozen
	- fp exceptions galore


todo
----
	- kill stdio; other than stdio uses, NULL -> nil; same for *printf
	- vid_9.c: remove/limit stupid
	- net_9p.c
	- net_udp.c + net_dgrm.c: actuallyport
	- snd_9.c: actuallyport
	- cd_9.c: everything; just specigy via cvar a folder and look for files there?
	- kill mouse on crash
	- mproc: better grabout shit
	- free mouselook without needing +mlook
	- plan9-like install
	- fix *Printf functions (console.c, sys_9.c, etc.)
	- do something about all the fucking shit printed in console
	- caps lock == Kctl
	- ungrab mouse when entering console or menus a la games/doom (IN_Grabm())
	- clean up *_9.c
	- linking errors with -T cflag
	- fix potential fp exceptions in code rather than ignoring them
