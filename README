qk1 - (9) quake
===============
	- setup:
		. mk install
		. mkdir id1
		. cp /n/quakecd/id1/*.pak id1/
		. run from same dir...
	- sound works, but is glitchy and reduces FPS quite a bit, esp. high resolutions
	- cdaudio, networking: PORTME
	- high resolutions work up to 4096x4096 (arbitrary limit in r_shared.h)
		. by default, quake uses a 8MB heap, which will be insufficient for higher
		resolutions → exit with "Hunk_Alloc: failed on ..."
			-> use -mem param, e.g.
			% qk1 -mem 24
		. resolutions under e.g. 320x240 don't work
	- don't use -winsize, -width, -height; just resize the window (bugsbugsbugs)
	- mouse is grabbed using m_windowed cvar
		. open console (~)
		. type m_windowed 1 (can autocomplete w/ tab)
		. setting saved on exit in id1/config.cfg
	- official expansions (rogue and hipnotic) work fine, mods could too
	- tested on 386 and amd64 only (works ok on a pentium 4)


some params useful for workarounds
----------------------------------
	-nosound
	-nostdout
	-mem %d
	(-noudp)
	(-winsize %d %d)
	(-width %d)
	(-height %d)


port notes
----------
	- based on linux/x11 code from original release
	- pr_strings: assumed 32bit pointer arithmetic: use PR_GetStr() instead of
	  dealing with it directly; may be ass
	- global cppdefotomy, removing code seen as useless for plan9
	- Sys_Warn added again for print(2) stuff in *_9.c that uses %r, kind of stupid
	since Con_Printf was often used there, and it outputs to both fd=1 and console,
	so needs fixing
	- m_freelook, as a quick hack to have (reversible) free mouse look
	- vid_9.c: shitty, can probably improve performance a bit without screwing code
	- snd_9.c: maybe writes to /dev/audio should be on another proc?
	- *printf -> *print was stupid
	- m_freelook is sort of useless, can just type +mlook in console, but that isn't
	saved on exit; maybe there's a better way


todo/issues
-----------
	- compile with PARANOID -> MSG_WriteByte complains about range error and
	  exits. no idea why.
	- new game while already ingame -> front falls off
		. most of the time: exits with R_RenderView: called without enough stack
		. sometimes: goes batshit on the console (->press y again and quit normally, etc.)
	- compile with BAN_TEST -> net_dgrm build fails
	- sprites/particles not scaled correctly on high resolutions
	- m_windowed 1: can still look around in frozen world when paused
	- net_9p.c
	- cd_9.c,net_udp.c,net_dgrm.c: actuallyport
	- snd_9.c, vid_9.c: lousy
	- plan9-like install (lib/quake rather than cwd), manpages
	- caps lock == Kctl (← kbdfs, notanissue?)
	- ungrab mouse when entering console or menus a la games/doom (IN_Grabm())
	- cleanse *_9.c from linux legacy
	- linking errors with -T cflag
	- fix potential fp exceptions in code rather than ignoring them?
	- sys_9.c: proper P9 use (style)
	- rewrite everything to use plan9 style? (ocd)
	- g '/\* FIXME'
	- port quakeworld and utilities +/- merge common code and mkmany
	- Sys_Error printing %r systematically is stupid
