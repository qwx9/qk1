qk1 - port of Quake to 9front
=============================
Does not work. Nothing to see here, move along.

builds only with p9p on linux/386 and amd64; bugged to hell.
actually, untested on 386, because linux crosscompiling and p9p on not-OSX.

plan9 shit missing completely, asm not ungccfied.

intrusive changes:
	- pr_strings: assumed 32bit pointer arithmetic: use PR_GetStr() instead of
	  dealing with it directly; may be ass
	- global cppdefotomy


bugs
----
	- compile with PARANOID -> MSG_WriteByte complains about range error and
	  exits. no idea why. (386/amd64)
	- new game while already ingame -> front falls off (amd64)
		. most of the time: exit with R_RenderView: called without enough stack


legal
-----
Quake, hence qk1, are licensed under the GPLv2. See COPYING for details.
